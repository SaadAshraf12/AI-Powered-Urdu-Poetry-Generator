# AI-Powered-Urdu-Poetry-Generator

This project is an AI-driven Urdu poetry generator that utilizes an LSTM-based deep learning model to compose poetic verses. Users input the first verse of a couplet, and the model generates the remaining lines in a coherent and stylistically appropriate manner. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing for an interactive and multilingual user interface. The model is trained on a large dataset of Urdu poetry and employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding layers. The project showcases how AI can be used creatively to generate poetic content while preserving linguistic and artistic authenticity.
